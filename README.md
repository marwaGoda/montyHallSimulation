# montyHallSimulation
This project simulates the monty hall statistics problem
## Problem description:
Assume that you are attending a TV show where you can win money by picking the right box.
 The game show host shows you three boxes explaining that the money is in one of the boxes.
  He asks you to pick one of them without opening it.
  After you have picked one of the boxes he opens one of the other two boxes which is empty.
   Now he turns to you and asks, do you want to change your mind, picking the remaining box?
## What this program do:
program in Java randomly simulating this event over and over again in the quest of answering following question.
 Do I stand a better chance to win if I change my mind? Maven should be used.
  The program has two modes, interactive mode where the user has the choice to choose boxes and see if he will win.
  and a simulation mode that provides the statistics of wins if the user will change his mind or keep the original choice
